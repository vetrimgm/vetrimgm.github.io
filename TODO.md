# TODO: Add Legal Blog/Latest News Section to Website

## Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Add new "Latest Legal News" section HTML to index.html after FAQs section
- [ ] Include 4 placeholder news items with title, excerpt, date, and "Read More" link
- [ ] Ensure section uses consistent styling (gold/navy theme, responsive grid)
- [ ] Test section display and responsiveness (if needed, add minor CSS adjustments)
- [ ] Verify disclaimer modal functionality (appears on first access, requires agreement)

## Notes:
- Section placed between FAQs and Contact sections
- Uses grid layout similar to reviews section
- Placeholder content for news items; links point to # for now
- Modal already implemented in JavaScript; checks localStorage for agreement
